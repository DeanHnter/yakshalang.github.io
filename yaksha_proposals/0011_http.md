# YAMA 0011 - Add minimal support for HTTP

- Author(s): Bhathiya Perera

## Summary
All programming languages provide a way to make HTTP requests. However, this is currently not available to Yaksha. This proposal aims to add minimal support for HTTP requests to Yaksha.

## Design

We plan on using mongoose to implement this feature. Mongoose is a lightweight HTTP server written in C. It is easy to integrate. However, it's license is GPL and users of http library will have to be aware of this.

## Client

Simple HTTP client will use following structure. This will be placed in a separate module called `http/client.yaka`.


```Yaksha
# Mongoose mgr data structure
@nativedefine("struct mg_mgr")
stuct MongooseMgr:
    pass

# Mongoose connection data structure
@nativedefine("struct mg_connection")
struct MongooseCon:
    pass

# HTTP client data structure using above 2 structs
struct HttpClient:
    mgr: MongooseMgr
    nc: Ptr[MongooseCon]
    success: bool

def http_client(url: sr) -> HttpClient:
    pass  # placeholder

def request(method: sr, url: sr, data: sr, callback: Function[..]) -> HttpRequest:
    pass  # placeholder
```

Usage of the client will be as follows:

```Yaksha
import http.client as client

def callback(...): # placeholder
    pass

def main() -> int:
    cl = client.http_client("http://localhost:8080")
    cl.request("GET", "/api/v1/users", "", callback)
    defer free_http_client(cl)
    return 0
```

# General update

## Astro / Tailwindcss / DaisyUi

Thanks to [GDWR](https://github.com/GDWR) and [fisher60](https://github.com/fisher60) from [AbandonTech](https://abandontech.cloud), Yaksha webiste is now recreated with Astro. 🎉

<Note mode="mascot">
* Astro allow you to build pages with `.md` and `.mdx` files. 
* You can also create components similar to React.
* Tailwindcss is the new kid on the block when it comes to a CSS framework. However, unlike bootstrap it is basically a CSS framework.
* DaisyUI - UI components built on top of Tailwindcss.
</Note>

😮‍💨 No more CSS (pain) for me. Thank you very much. 🤣

## v0.0.5 is out

v0.0.5 was released recently with plenty of new features.

* `sr` data type is a game changer with the ability to encapsulate `string literals`, `sds strings (not copied)`, `c strings`
* Number auto cast from smaller numbers to larger.
* String auto cast and default to internal compile time `:s:` string literal data type whenever posible.
* MacOS binaries are now built with github actions.

# Yaksha Library

Yaksha library uses multiple 3rd party libraries, set of python scripts and few other nuts and bolts to create library sources. 

Core parts of runtime library functionality starts with `yk__` or `YK__`.

Yaksha programming language preserves anything that starts with `yk__` or `YK__` while prefixing any other name with `yy__`. 

<Note mode="icon">This avoids collisions with C standard library functions or keywords.</Note>

Build with [Astro](https://astro.build/) + [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) & [DaisyUi](https://daisyui.com/). 

## Quick Start

0. [Install Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) (will require NodeJs)
1. `yarn # Installs dependecies`
2. `yarn dev # Runs development server` 


## Astro Brief

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
